Sentiment analysis is a technique to distinguish positive and negative opinions from textual data and a prominent application in natural language processing. 
It is being applied in multiple areas such as customer feedback, movie or product reviews, and political comments. While sentiment analysis can help identify
the sentiment behind an opinion or statement, there might be several aspects in the very same sentence/paragraph. To ease this challenge, Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)
takes into consideration the terms related to the aspects and identifies the sentiment associated with each aspect. ABSA model requires aspect categories and its corresponding aspect terms to extract sentiment for each aspect from the text corpus. In recent years, deep language models, such as BERT, 
have shown great progress in this regard. 

The core of my work is this chronological order in the development of the models the ABSA literature from traditional machine learning models 
to attention-based transformer models and application of BERT model into the ABSA tasks "Aspect Category Detection", "Aspect Term Extraction", and "Sentiment Polarity"
