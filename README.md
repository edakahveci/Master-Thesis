Sentiment analysis is a technique to extract positive and negative evaluations from textual data and a prominent application in the field of natural language processing. It can help identify single sentiments or aspects in an evaluation. However, it is insufficient when there are several sentiments or aspects contained in a single sentence or paragraph. Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) offers a solution to this shortcoming as it is able to capture multiple aspects simultaneously and to identify the sentiment associated with each aspect. Since its introduction, researchers have been applying various different machine learning models in the context of ABSA. Among them, attention-based transformer models, such as BERT, have been shown to be more effective than  traditional machine learning models and neural networks. This thesis serves two primary purposes. Firstly, to give an overview of different models that have been used in the literature over time. In particular, it is argued that BERT has been increasingly used due to its attention mechanism. Secondly, task-specific BERT models were applied to three ABSA tasks and compared to previous models. They showed higher F1-scores than their benchmark models in each of the tasks.
